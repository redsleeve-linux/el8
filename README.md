# Redsleeve / EL8

**RedSleeve Linux** is a 3rd party [ARM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture) port of a Linux distribution of a Prominent North American Enterprise Linux Vendor (PNAELV). They object to being referred to by name in the context of clones and ports of their distribution, but if you are aware of [CentOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CentOS), you can probably guess what [RedSleeve](http://www.redsleeve.org) is based on.
